# Current Status

This file is the compact official state for the project. Milestone documents
and `docs/research-log.md` remain the detailed experiment log.

## Project Identity

- Repository: `general-evasive-driver`
- Current Python package name: `autodrift`
- Working title: General Evasive Driver
- Core direction: closed-loop RL driver for handling-limit emergency avoidance,
  with drift as one possible maneuver rather than the project identity.

## Current Research Blocker

Latest completed milestone:

```text
m2488-source-only-closed-loop-fixture-pilot-implementation-preflight
```

Latest attempted milestone:

```text
m2488-source-only-closed-loop-fixture-pilot-implementation-preflight
result: completed
```

Current next task:

```text
m2489-source-only-closed-loop-fixture-pilot-result-audit
```

Current route:

```text
M2488 implements and runs the bounded source_only_closed_loop_fixture_pilot
preflight. It admits a same-contract 72-observation / 3-action recurrent actor
checkpoint and executes 60 deterministic policy-action steps over the three
M2484 source-only fixtures. The next task is a result audit before any longer
pilot or claim escalation.
```

The materialization preserves P0 observation shape `72`, action shape `3`, and the rule
that scenario labels, feasibility classes, hidden dynamics, per-wheel forces,
fault scales, TTC, required clearance, reward terms, and success labels remain
metadata-only.

M2488 did not install, import, or run an external high-fidelity simulator. It
did not run measured validation, training, replay, PPO,
controller ranking, winner selection, or any paper/FW-vs-GRU/self-ID/current-
sim/high-fidelity validation verdict.

The active next task is M2489: audit the M2488 summary and 60 rollout rows. It
must not execute new policy actions, train, rank, select a winner, or claim
performance or validation.

## Latest Evidence

M2471 remains the active route pivot after the post-M2470 synthesis:

```text
decision:
  freeze current-sim as a diagnostic/mining layer
  stop direct static current-sim materialization as the immediate route
  start high-fidelity interface preparation now
```

Current-sim scenario-readiness evidence remains useful but not driver
capability evidence:

```text
M2468 reset-only attempts: 120
M2468 reset successes: 109
stable_aes_support: 14/24
stable-AES failures: 10/11 total reset failures
partial stable-AES cells:

## Current Interpretation Boundary

Allowed claim:

```text
The HF0 interface boundary has checked local contract primitives, a current-sim
adapter smoke, a bounded external-backend route design, a dependency/API audit,
branch synthesis, source-only four-wheel adapter preflight, and scenario
taxonomy mapping design/materialization. These preserve the canonical P0
actor/action contract and keep diagnostics outside actor input. M2481 also
designs fixture admissions for limited rows, and M2482 materializes a checked
fixture catalog. M2483 designs and M2484 executes a bounded source-only fixture
smoke protocol. M2485 audits that smoke and explicitly rejects performance
overclaims. M2486 closes the HF0 interface branch and promotes to a bounded
source-only closed-loop pilot design. M2487 defines the same-contract actor
admission and source-only pilot implementation preflight. M2488 runs that
bounded policy-action path smoke. These do not prove driver capability.
```

Blocked claims:

```text
high-fidelity validation readiness
driver performance improvement
current-sim benchmark readiness
controller-family ranking
winner selection
paper-level benchmark evidence
finite-window vs GRU conclusion
level3 self-identification evidence
scenario redesign success
training repair success
```

## Immediate Next Step

M2489 should audit the bounded source-only closed-loop fixture pilot from:

```text
runs/m2488_source_only_closed_loop_fixture_pilot_preflight/summary.json
runs/m2488_source_only_closed_loop_fixture_pilot_preflight/pilot_rollout_rows.csv
docs/m2488-source-only-closed-loop-fixture-pilot-implementation-preflight.md
runs/m1154_row15_promoted_unsafe_margin_projection_probe/checkpoints/alpha_0_05.pt
```

The audit must verify checkpoint admission, row counts, observation/action
shape gates, action finiteness/bounds, backend statuses, wheel diagnostic
counts, and actor-input leak flags. It must not install, import, or run external
high-fidelity simulation, execute new policy action, train, replay, use PPO,
rank controllers, select a winner, promote a checkpoint, compute success-rate
verdicts, or claim high-fidelity validation, current-sim verdict, paper-level
evidence, finite-window-vs-GRU evidence, or level-3 self-identification.
