# Current Status

This file is the compact official state for the project. Milestone documents
remain the detailed experiment log.

## Project Identity

- Repository: `general-evasive-driver`
- Current Python package name: `autodrift`
- Working title: General Evasive Driver
- Core direction: closed-loop RL driver for handling-limit emergency avoidance,
  with drift as one possible maneuver rather than the project identity.

## Actor Contract

Mainline actor:

```text
P0 human-view no-wheel 72-dim frame + online GRU hidden state
```

Allowed deployable inputs:

- ego kinematics / IMU-like response;
- steering, throttle, and brake actuator state;
- previous physical commands;
- road / free-space / obstacle geometry in ego frame;
- recurrent state from past command-response history.

Not allowed in the deployable actor:

- `mu`, mass, CG, tire stiffness, brake scale, actuator time constants;
- slip ratio, slip angle, tire force, tire saturation, friction margin;
- AEB/AES/drift-required feasibility labels;
- controller mode or rule branch;
- `speed_ref`, `beta_target`, path error, heading error, path curvature;
- TTC, required clearance, oracle stopping distance, reference trajectory;
- collision/success/progress labels or any precomputed answer.

## Current Checkpoints

Latest public-gate base:

```text
runs/m399_s02_interpolation/checkpoints/alpha_0_05.pt
```

Status: M400 promoted M399 alpha `0.05` as the current public-gate base after
six public replay surfaces and behavior seeds passed. M487-M529 did not promote
a new driver checkpoint.

Latest infrastructure smoke checkpoint:

```text
runs/m528_l0_current_observation_smoke/checkpoint.pt
```

Status: M528 smoke-only L0 current-observation checkpoint. It validates
baseline route and metadata, not driver performance.

## Current Blocker

```text
m540-matched-history-training-variance-design
```

M540 should pre-register the next matched L0/L2/L3 training-variance escalation.
It must keep budgets, seeds, eval order, and public/private evidence boundaries
identical across history levels before launching longer matched training.

## Recent Evidence Line

- M520 valid-offset projected replay produced only a margin-only projected
  history signal: `1` source-narrow wrong-history proof candidate and `0` event
  rows.
- M524 found stronger natural history-value diagnostics: `480` L0 diagnostic
  candidates and `18` obstacle-completion event rows across natural M497/M487
  surfaces.
- M526 audited those event rows as source-diverse diagnostic evidence:
  `18` obstacle-completion drops across `2` surfaces, `5` probe seeds, and
  `2` targets, with projected event rows excluded.
- M527 defined the matched baseline family: L0 feedforward/current observation,
  L1 one-step command-response annotation, L2 finite command-response window,
  and L3 online GRU recurrent belief.
- M528 implemented explicit baseline metadata and an L0 smoke path while
  preserving the P0 no-wheel/no-oracle actor contract.
- M529 pre-registered the staged matched-baseline evaluation ladder so later
  L0/L2/L3 comparisons use shared budgets, seeds, configs, artifacts, and
  holdout discipline.
- M530 repeated the L0 current-observation smoke on seeds `3530` and `3531`.
  Both completed and wrote stable `L0_current_observation` plus
  `P0_human_view_no_wheel_no_oracle` metadata. The smoke returns are not
  interpreted as baseline evidence.
- M531 added machine-checkable L0/L2/L3 short-train configs with shared PPO
  budget, seed, task distribution, and P0 contract checks. L2 is the only config
  with `history_length = 4`; L0 and L3 use `history_length = 1`.
- M532 ran all three short-train configs on seed `3530`. L0 and L2 terminated
  in all eval episodes, while L3 had lower termination rate (`0.6`) and higher
  return on this one seed. This is route/artifact evidence only; repeat seeds
  and natural history-value surface evals are still required.
- M533 repeated the frozen configs on seeds `3531` and `3532`. Across seeds
  `3530`-`3532`, L3 has the best average return/termination (`45.7765`/`0.6`),
  L2 is second (`39.9082`/`0.6667`), and L0 is third (`27.3016`/`0.8667`).
  This is preliminary route evidence only; natural history-value surface eval is
  the next evidence layer.
- M534 designed that next layer. Existing recurrent-only tail gates are not
  enough for matched L0/L2/L3 evaluation, so the next tool must reconstruct
  natural source states with M399, replay L0/L2/L3 from the same frozen
  state/history, keep M526 rows as public diagnostics, and exclude projected
  surfaces from natural claims.
- M535 implemented that evaluator. It supports L0 current-frame replay, L2
  current-first stacked history replay, and L3 hidden construction from source
  observation prefixes. Focused tests pass, and a real 2-pair short-reveal smoke
  produced `6` outcome rows with `0` invalid rows.
- M536 scaled the evaluator to all nine matched short-train checkpoints on
  small short-reveal and warmup natural subsets. It produced `279` valid outcome
  rows total with one diagnosed short-reveal source-tail miss. L0/L2/L3 tied on
  success/completion/collision, while L3 had the best mean clearance margin.
  This is still route evidence only.
- M537 ran the full public frozen-source natural-surface matrix across M497
  short/warmup and M487 near/late splits. It produced `20196` valid outcome rows
  and no metadata or actor-contract failures. L3 leads aggregate success
  (`0.851901`), collision rate (`0.148099`), and mean clearance margin
  (`1.654668`) versus both L0 and L2, and is best on every per-surface success
  and margin table. The public M526 event overlay also favors L3, but this is
  still public diagnostic evidence rather than private generalization or
  checkpoint promotion.
- M538 converted the M537 result into exact paired source-key deltas. The join
  is complete (`6732` triplets, `0` incomplete). L3-L0 is robust across all
  surfaces and all three training seeds, with paired success delta `+0.020351`
  and margin delta `+0.144301`. L3-L2 is aggregate-positive and positive on all
  surfaces, but not seed-uniform: seed `3531` favors L2 with success delta
  `-0.013815` and margin delta `-0.143703`.
- M539 diagnoses the seed `3531` L2-over-L3 counterexample. It is broad rather
  than an event artifact: all four surfaces, all target groups, and all
  tail-offset groups have negative mean L3-L2 margin deltas. The `31` success
  regressions are all `L2 obstacle_completed -> L3 collision`, and non-event
  rows carry the success/collision regression. L3 seed `3531` has a systematic
  first-action shift relative to L2, so the next step should address matched
  training variance rather than promote L3 from public diagnostics.

## Near-Term Rule

Do not treat reset-hidden diagnostics, M528 smoke return, or M537-M539 public
diagnostics as private generalization evidence. The next branch must design a
matched training-variance escalation that keeps L2 as a serious finite-window
baseline. Any later promotion requires proof retention, generalization
retention, behavior retention, no contract violation, and clear lineage.

## Sensor Profile Policy

Keep raw wheel, `v_parallel`, steering torque, suspension, and similar channels
as separate profile experiments only. Do not promote them into the main actor
without passing the same frozen-recipe proof gates as P0.

Suggested future profile ladder:

| Profile | Inputs |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | current no-wheel human-view baseline |
| P1 | commands + actuator feedback + `ax/ay/yaw_rate` + scene |
| P2 | P1 + steering torque / EPS current |
| P3 | P2 + raw four-wheel `R omega` |
| P4 | P3 + roll/pitch/vertical acceleration |
| P5 | P4 + suspension / wheel travel |

Every profile must use the same gate sequence: probe, frozen PPO recipe,
matched-current wrong-history, reset/zero-current ablation, and outcome boundary
proof. Do not tune PPO separately for one profile and compare it directly.
